# MTG Deck Builder

This project consists of an MTG deck building tool primarily focused on the **Commander** format. The main data source for the process will be **[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)** through it's [public API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api).

The tool will initially only serve as a place to build the deck and export it to other platforms (in the most common deck export formats), there is no backend and no persistance of any of the data other than local browser storage.

## Run Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
